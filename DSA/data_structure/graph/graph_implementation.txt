In adjacency List:
    - Use Vector of Vectors:
        -> When the graph is dense or moderately sparse.
        -> When iteration and cache performance are critical.
        -> When the focus is on simplicity and compatibility with STL algorithms.

    - Use Vector of Linked List Heads:
        -> When the graph is very sparse.
        -> When frequent edge deletions are required.
        -> When memory usage due to resizing is a concern. (insertion takes O(1) deletion takes O(n))

    In most cases, a vector of vectors is preferred for its simplicity, better performance in modern systems, 
    and reduced memory overhead. However, for graphs with frequent edge deletions or extremely sparse edges,
    vector of linked list heads can be beneficial.
