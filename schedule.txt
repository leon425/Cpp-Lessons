- Create our own hashtable. for prim's algorithm
- custom hash function. Refer from introduction to algorithm hashtable
- Create random true and false BST. input is the length. should you create balanced and imbalance? how to measure it?

NEXT:
- insertVertex() and insertEdge() have possible error of inserting double hashmap value & ajdList index
- deleteVertex() and deleteEdge() 
- djikstra algorithm
- simplify double directed graph into undirected graph


Prim's Algorithm:
- First, brainstorm the big picture again without coding. Build a clear blueprint & sequence. Where to loop, the order, etc.
When every single conditional and every single steps is measured & tested, then you code.
- Change to normal undirected graph
- Add conditional whether the new edge creates a cycle or not
